## repository structure

Here's a quick breakdown of what to find where in the repository:

* [Theory](markdown/theory.md) 💭 describes the the BB84 algorithm and required theory
* [Hardware](markdown/hardware.md) 🔭 collects information about which hardware was used and how to set it up
* [3D models](3d-models) 🏗️ holds printable components
* [Setup](markdown/setup.md) 🧑🏻‍💻 installation instructions for the software and required services
* [Notebooks](notebooks) 🪐 contains the actual JupyterLab Notebooks for Alice, Bob and Eve
* [Guidelines](markdown/guidelines.md) ✒️  coding and contribution guidelines

## frequently asked questions

**Why build some components instead of using the respective ThorLabs versions?**

Mainly to keep it open-source and reduce the size of the hardware setup. As an added bonus it lowers the cost and barrier of entry for anyone who is interested in replicating the project.

**What hardware do I need to run this project?**

See [Hardware](markdown/hardware.md) for a list of required components and [3D models](3d-models) for printable parts.

**Is Python 3.9 absolutely required?**

Yes. We make use of some of the [new features](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html).

**When running `pip install -r requirements.txt` it fails with `Building wheel for smbus (setup.py) ... error`.**

You are probably not on a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian (or a similar operating system). This is due to missing I2C. If you're just interested in seeing the notebooks and running some parts of them you can remove the smbus line from `requirements.txt`. You won't be able to use the quantum channel, of course.
